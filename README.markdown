Description
=============

This is the Jekyll source for Gabriel Horner's blog and website(http://tagaholic.me).
It's forked from [Mister Bleigh's ](http://github.com/mbleigh/mbleigh.github.com).
It makes some nice use of Jekyll's liquid templating system (see blog.html) and uses Javascript to pull information from GitHub for the open-source section.

The licensing is the same as mbleigh's:
