I gave a talk on "Design By Contract to the Queensland JVM Group":http://www.meetup.com/qldjvm/events/55952912/ on April 10 2012.  Here is the summary:

bq. 
Design by contract (DbC) is an approach for designing software using precise interface specifications for software components. These specifications primarily use preconditions, postconditions and invariants and act as a metaphor for the conditions and obligations of business contracts. In this talk, Mark will use Google's Contracts For Java library to: 
- Explain DbC and it's benefits 
- Demonstrate how DbC can be integrated into Java projects 
- Explain DbC's relationship with testing and type theory 

The video is up on "Vimeo":http://vimeo.com/40274032:
