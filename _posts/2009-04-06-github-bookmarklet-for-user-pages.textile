description: I have a confession to make. I use <a href="http://github.com">github</a> <b>all the time</b>. In order to feed the addiction, I decided to logically awesomeize github's user page. What ensued was a jQuery plugin/bookmarklet which enhances the github user page with repository sorting. And yes, my addiction has only gotten worse.

h2. Test Drive

Copy the bookmarklet:

    <a style="padding-left: 30px;font-size:150%" href='javascript:(function(){$.getScript("http://tagaholic.me/javascripts/jquery.githubUserPage.js",function(){$.githubUserPage()})})()'>Github User Page Bookmarklet</a>

When you're on a github user page ("exemplar awesome dude":http://github.com/defunkt), paste the above bookmarklet in your address bar and hit @enter@. While you're waiting for it to fetch the user's data, you'll see a bookmarklet status box. Once it's loaded you should notice three major changes: a sort box above the first repository, additional user stats and the number of watchers and forks in the upper right hand corner of each repository. For defunkt's page, it'll look like this:

<img alt="bookmarklet example" src="/images/post-ghub_bookmarklet_example.gif" />

With the sort box, you can now sort a user's repositories by name, fork count, watchers count, or last updated date in ascending or descending order!

*Update*: I've added some more features:
* Sort by last updated date.
* The visibility of forked repositories can be toggled with the toggle link.
* Added additional user stats after 'Member Since'. These stats compare non-forked versus forked repositories. For the above snapshot in the watcher average stat, 48.2 refers to the average number of watchers for defunkt's non-forked repositories while 3.8 refers to the average number for his forked repositories. Fork Average refers to average number of forks.

h2. Install

So if you like the bookmarklet and want to use it again, here are some ways to install/reuse this bookmarklet:
* You can drag the above bookmarklet link to your bookmarks toolbar. When you're on a github user page, click on it to start the bookmarklet.
* If you're on firefox, you can use the "ubiquity extension":https://ubiquity.mozilla.com/ to execute the bookmarklet as a command. *Update:* "Ubiquity command is here":http://gist.github.com/91353
* For a browser-independent web command similar to ubiquity, I'd recommend "queriac":http://queri.ac. Since I use it often and am its primary developer, I'm slightly biased. Here's the "queriac command for this bookmarklet":http://queriac/commands/ghuser.
* If you want the bookmarklet on all the time, you can make a greasemonkey script from this bookmarklet and put it up on "their script repository":http://userscripts.org/.

If you make a web command from this bookmarklet, let me know and I can link back to it here.

h2. Innards

If you want to play with the bookmarklet, "clone/fork it on github":http://github.com/cldwalker/github_user_page.js:
<pre class="github">
  git clone git://github.com/cldwalker/github_user_page.js.git
</pre>

Here's a quick explanation of how it works:
# Detects the github username from the current url.
# Displays a bookmarklet status box.
# Fetches the user's json data per "the github api":http://github.com/guides/the-github-api.
# Iterates over the page's repositories, adding additional repo stats from the json object.
# Load "the sort plugin":http://plugins.jquery.com/project/selso which we use to sort the repositories.
# Replace the status box with a box that allows sorting on multiple repository fields and toggling of forked repositories.
# Calculate and display some additional user stats.
