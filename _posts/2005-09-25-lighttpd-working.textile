# Installed typo
## installed the latest tarball from "http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems/":http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems
## @gem install rails@
## @svn checkout svn://leetsoft.com/typo/trunk typo@
# Installed fcgi and lighttpd
## @apt-get install libfcgi-ruby1.8 libpcre3-dev@
    __note: pcre needed for mod_rewrite__
## downloaded latest tarball (1.4.4) for "lighttpd":http://lighttpd.net/download/
# Configuration
## Copied the "script":http://www.bigbold.com/snippets/posts/show/504 into my script/ in the typo rails directory
## @chmod +x script/light_rails@
## began lighttpd with @script/light_rails -b 72.0.101.155 -a typo -p 80@
## modified script/light_rails to use mod_status and mod_simple_vhost

Make sure to modify your dns records so that your virtual host is recognized by everyone’s browsers. Otherwise you’ll get @$url could not be found. Please try again.@ from firefox.

I also used the following resources:

1. "rails wiki":http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails – search for lighttpd
2. Naturally "lighttpd":http://lighttpd.net/documentation/
3. "http://hieraki.simplicio.com/read/chapter/1":http://hieraki.simplicio.com/read/chapter/1
