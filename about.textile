title: About Me
---
I'm passionate about knowledge management, linked data (semantic web) and ruby. One day I hope to bring back that passion back to physics.

*I'm available for hire*. I'm particularly interested in ruby and/or rails work that involves the above passions. See "my creative resume":/resume.html or "the more standard one":http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dhjdhqhp_4sdt4jmhp.
