I gave a talk on http://www.meetup.com/qldjvm/events/55952912/[Design By Contract to the Queensland JVM Group] on April 10 2012.  Here is the summary:

[quote]
____
Design by contract (DbC) is an approach for designing software using precise interface specifications for software components. These specifications primarily use preconditions, postconditions and invariants and act as a metaphor for the conditions and obligations of business contracts. In this talk, Mark will use Google's Contracts For Java library to:

* Explain DbC and it's benefits
* Demonstrate how DbC can be integrated into Java projects
* Explain DbC's relationship with testing and type theory
